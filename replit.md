# Telegram Truth or Dare Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot built using Python that implements a Truth or Dare game. The bot is designed to handle basic messaging and provide interactive gaming functionality for Telegram users. It uses the `python-telegram-bot` library for seamless integration with Telegram's Bot API.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple, monolithic architecture with a single Python file (`bot.py`) containing all the bot logic. The architecture is event-driven, responding to Telegram messages and commands through webhook handlers.

### Core Components:
- **Bot Handler**: Main application logic using `python-telegram-bot` framework
- **Game Logic**: Truth or Dare functionality with predefined question sets
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Framework Integration
- **Technology**: `python-telegram-bot` library
- **Purpose**: Handles all Telegram API interactions, message processing, and command routing
- **Implementation**: Uses Application, CommandHandler, and MessageHandler classes

### 2. Game Engine
- **Truth Questions**: Static list of 19 pre-defined truth questions
- **Dare Challenges**: (Implementation appears incomplete in current codebase)
- **Random Selection**: Uses Python's random module for question/dare selection

### 3. Logging System
- **Framework**: Python's built-in logging module
- **Configuration**: INFO level logging with timestamp and component identification
- **Purpose**: Debugging, monitoring, and error tracking

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**: Telegram sends updates to the bot via webhooks or polling
2. **Handler Routing**: Application routes messages to appropriate handlers based on content/commands
3. **Game Logic Processing**: Bot processes game requests and selects random truth questions or dares
4. **Response Generation**: Bot formats and sends responses back to users via Telegram API
5. **Logging**: All interactions are logged for monitoring and debugging

## External Dependencies

### Required Python Packages:
- `python-telegram-bot`: Primary framework for Telegram bot development
- `logging`: Built-in Python logging (no external dependency)
- `random`: Built-in Python random number generation
- `os`: Built-in Python environment variable access
- `typing`: Built-in Python type hints

### External Services:
- **Telegram Bot API**: All bot interactions go through Telegram's official API
- **Bot Token**: Requires a valid bot token from @BotFather on Telegram

## Deployment Strategy

The bot is designed for simple deployment patterns:

### Environment Configuration:
- Bot token should be stored as an environment variable for security
- No database requirements in current implementation
- Stateless design allows for easy horizontal scaling

### Hosting Options:
- Can be deployed on any Python-compatible platform (Replit, Heroku, VPS, etc.)
- Supports both webhook and polling modes for receiving updates
- Minimal resource requirements due to simple architecture

## Development Notes

### Current Status:
- Truth questions are fully implemented with 19 predefined questions
- Dare functionality appears incomplete (handler and questions list missing)
- Basic bot structure is in place but needs completion

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Monolithic Structure**: Chosen for simplicity and ease of development
2. **Static Question Lists**: Provides consistent game experience without database complexity
3. **Event-Driven Design**: Aligns with Telegram's callback-based API model
4. **Stateless Operation**: Simplifies deployment and scaling

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
